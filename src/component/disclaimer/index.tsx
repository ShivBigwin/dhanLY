            Integrity and transparency form the core of Aadi Finance Pvt Ltd's
            business values. We adhere to stringent regulations set by oversight
            authorities, including the Reserve Bank of India, ensuring that all
            our loan disbursement processes maintain the highest standards of
            legality and ethical compliance.

            However, we have become aware that certain fraudulent entities are
            falsely representing themselves as being associated with DhanLY Pvt
            Ltd. These deceptive operations attempt to mislead individuals by
            demanding advance payments for loan approvals—a practice we strictly
            prohibit and condemn.

              We must emphasize the critical importance of exercising extreme
              caution with any entity that demands an advance payment for a
              loan. We urge you to remain vigilant and avoid such organizations
              entirely. Please be assured that we are actively pursuing all
              available legal measures to stop these fraudulent practices and
              protect our valued customers.

              We are dedicated to conducting business with integrity and

              up-front costs associated with loan applications or associated
              services at Aadi Finance Pvt Ltd. Any demand for upfront payment
              coming from unapproved sources is blatantly fraudulent and goes
              against our policies.
