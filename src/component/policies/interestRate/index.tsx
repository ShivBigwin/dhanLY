                      The interest rate and yield for each loan product will be
                      determined by the Asset Liability Management Committee

                    <p>
                      Interest rates will be based on various factors, including
                      the loan term, payment terms (monthly, quarterly, yearly),
                      repayment terms, moratorium periods, bullet payments,

                    <p>
                      Factors influencing the interest rate include the cost of
                      borrowed funds, matching tenor cost, market liquidity,
                      refinance avenues, competition offerings, customer
                      relationship tenure, disbursement costs, and other
                      cost-related elements (Cost of Fund). Additionally, credit
                      and default risk, customer segment, customer profile,
                      professional qualifications, earning and employment
                      stability, repayment ability, customer yield, risk
                      premium, primary and collateral securities, past repayment
                      track record, external ratings, creditworthiness, and

                      Business costs will be factored into the interest rates,

                      transaction size, borrower location, and other related

                      The Company may use an interest rate model where the same
                      product and tenor availed during the same period may have
                      different interest rates for different customers based on
                      the factors mentioned above. Thus, interest rates may vary

                      The annualized interest rate will be communicated to the
                      customer. Interest rates may be fixed, floating, or
                      variable. The prime lending rate for floating rates will
                      be reviewed periodically. For floating rates, the interest
                      rate will be reviewed and decided by the Company
                      periodically. The methodology for calculating the annual
                      percentage rate (AAPL) may change with ALCO's approval.
